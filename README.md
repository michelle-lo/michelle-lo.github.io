## Software Engineering

I love coming up with creative solutions to everyday problems. Below, you can find some of my project experience.

### AI Sales Training Chatbot

**Jan 2025 ‚Äì Present**

> OpenAI, TypeScript, Python, Docker, RESTful APIs, React, AWS, GitHub, MaterialUI, Firebase

As part of a 6-person team and guided by 3 advisors in the xLab program, we developed an AI chatbot to simulate sales training conversations. The goal was to reduce the time and cost required to train sales and customer support associates.

I contributed primarily to the frontend, helping build the dashboard and the infrastructure for voice and text communication with the AI agent. I also led much of the project management work‚Äîgathering requirements and maintaining communication with the client.

> JavaScript, React, Vercel, OpenAI, RESTful APIs, CSS, MaterialUI, GitHub, Supabase

See our project [here](https://pantry-ai-peach.vercel.app/)!

PantryAI generates recipes using ingredients from your pantry. With features like pantry management, meal planning, and social sharing, it helps reduce food waste while inspiring creativity in the kitchen.

This was one of the first successful projects I helped build from scratch as part of a 5-person team. I led backend development for the AI recipe generator and also built our app-exclusive ‚ÄúFor Your Taste‚Äù page. I gained experience in both software engineering and project management, including writing SRS documents, design specs, and functional test plans.

## Data Science

In the least nerdy way possible‚ÄîI find data fascinating. I love uncovering stories, trends, and actionable insights from numbers. Here are a few examples of my work:

### Data Mining Projects

**Aug 2024 ‚Äì Dec 2024**

> Python, PyTorch

Tested various data mining and machine learning techniques in a course setting.
